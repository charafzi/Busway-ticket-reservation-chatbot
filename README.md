# Busway Reservation System

This project is designed during the OOP workshop. It enables passengers to book their bus tickets in real-time by using a chatbot.

1. **Bus Information installation**

   - Allows to set up typical busway information before they can be booked by passengers.

2. **Reservation**

   - Passengers can reserve a seat on a bus if the seat limit is not reached.
   - The system generates a QR Code for the ticket.

3. **Display Reservation Information**

   - Displays all information about the buses.

4. **Available Buses**
   - Displays buses available for reservation.

## Data Storage

- Use Neo4j for data storage and management.

## Chatbot

- Implement a chatbot to facilitate automatic ticket reservations.
- Use Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) for basic rule definition in the NLU unit of the chatbot.
